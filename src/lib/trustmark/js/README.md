# TrustMark JavaScript example

The [`js`](https://github.com/adobe/trustmark/tree/main/js) directory contains an example JavaScript implementation of decoding TrustMark watermarks embedded in images. It provides a minimal example of a client-side JavaScript application, would could be applied, for example, to a browser extension.

## Overview

The example consists of key modules that handle image preprocessing, watermark detection, and data decoding. It supports the `Q` variant of the TrustMark watermarking schema.

NOTE: The TrustMark JavaScript implementation only decodes watermarked images, in contrast to the Python implementation, which can both encode and decode.

## Components

This example consists of a simple HTML file, `index.html` that loads two JavaScript files:

- [`tm_watermark.js`](https://github.com/adobe/trustmark/blob/main/js/tm_watermark.js), the core module that handles watermark detection and decoding and defines key functions for processing images and extracting watermark data. The `modelConfigs` array specifies parameters such as the TrustMark model variant. As provided, the code checks for both Q and P variants.
- [`tm_datalayer.js`](https://github.com/adobe/trustmark/blob/main/js/tm_datalayer.js) handles data decoding and schema-specific processing.  It also implements error correction and interpretation of binary watermark data.

If GPU compute is available (if you're using Google Chrome, check `chrome://gpu`), then the code will automatically use WebGPU to process the ONNX models.  If you use WebGPU it will only run in a secure context, which means on localhost or an HTTPS link.  You can start a local HTTPS server by running the `server.py` script and a suitable OpenSSL certificate in `server.pem`.

## Key parameters

The desired TrustMark watermark variants for decoding are listed in the `modelConfigs` array at the top of `tm_watermark.js` for example, B, C, Q and P variants:

```js
const modelConfigs = [
  { variantcode: 'Q', fname: 'decoder_Q', sessionVar: 'session_wmarkQ', resolution: 256, squarecrop: false }, 
  { variantcode: 'P', fname: 'decoder_P', sessionVar: 'session_wmarkP', resolution: 224, squarecrop: true },
];
```

## Run the example

To run the example:

1. Start a local web server; for example, using Python:

```sh
python -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open `index.html` in a browser to run the example.

3. Drag and drop images (for example from the provided [`images`](https://github.com/adobe/trustmark/tree/main/images) directory) onto the indicated area in the web page, which will display information if the image contains a TrustMark watermark (see example below).

To use the code in your own project, simply include the two JavaScript files as usual.

## Example output

For an image containing a TrustMark watermark:

```json
[4:12:48 PM] Decoding watermark...
[4:12:48 PM] Watermark Found (BCH_5):

      }
    ]
  }
}
```
